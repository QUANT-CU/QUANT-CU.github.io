        <h1>Quantitative Computational Finance Club at Chulalongkorn University</h1>
        <p>
            Quantitative Computational Finance Club at Chulalongkorn University (Quant CU) is a community of students at Chulalongkorn University interested in quantitative finance. Our goal is to create a space where we can learn, research, organize sessions, and share knowledge to build a strong foundation in this field. Our activities are supported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/quantcornerthailand/">QuantCorner</a>, the Thai quant analyst community.</p>
        <p>
            We aim to approach finance using the scientific method and a multidisciplinary perspective. Our members come from diverse fields such as mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, economics, and finance. We welcome students from any other department as well!</p>

    <h2>What is Quant?</h2>
    <p>Quant is short for quantitative analysis, an investment approach using mathematical models and programming for data-driven financial decisions. While fundamental and technical analysis are more popular abroad, quantitative analysis in Thailand is still in its early stages. You may watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAYOb0qGdKc">this video</a> for more details.</p>
    <h2>The Origin of This Club</h2>
    <p>In March 2024, QuantCorner and the London Stock Exchange Group organized a quant hackathon for college students called <a href="https://www.quant-corner.com/hackathon-2024">"The Quest For Sustainable Alpha"</a>. The aim of the hackathon was to explore the question of whether sustainability factors can potentially generate returns.</p>
    <p>After the competition, participants from Chulalongkorn University discussed with QuantCorner and decided to form a club at the university. This club aims to continue studying quantitative finance and pursuing research, with technical support from QuantCorner.</p>
    <h2>What Are We Doing Now? (Updated: 21 July 2024)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We have just made our club official and set it up under the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/escchula/">Engineering Student Committee</a> because it’s convenient and open to all students. If we grow in the coming year, we might move under the CU Innovation Hub.</li>
        <li>We now have heads for mathematics, finance, and programming (the three main fields of quantitative finance), and all of them are preparing their classes to support the foundation in their areas. The Python for Beginners class will begin on July 25. </li>
        <li>After seeing The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9m7NgvSiT9/">KAsset x CUVI Investment Bootcamp</a>, there's been talk in the Thai Quant Community about creating a quantitative finance bootcamp. Our core team is currently listing the topics we’d like to include, so we can reach out to experts if possible. If you have any ideas or requests, please share them in the #อยากเรียนอะไร channel on our Discord server.</li>
        <li>We now have two teams competing in <a href="https://www.set.or.th/th/education-research/research/research-grant/project">a competition organized by The Stock Exchange of Thailand</a>. If you're interested in starting a new team, feel free to send a direct message to  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/touchvaritnote/">the club president massenger</a>. If you're passionate, QuantCorner will provide support to help you get ready.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What Have We Done? (2024)</h2>
        <li>March: Chulalongkorn University students competed in a quant hackathon organized by QuantCorner and LSEG.</li>
        <li>April: After the competition, we discussed the idea of forming a club to further research this topic. We planned to start a club and also requested QuantCorner to be our supporter.</li> 
        <li>May: We hosted two public sessions on the topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVN8iOjSjN0&t=4479s">derivatives quant</a> at the Faculty of Engineering and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gJVa2eMsEB1uyHR_Kw4tOIENp8oQvjgu?usp=sharing">an introductory session</a> for curious students at SAMYAN CO-OP.</li>
        <li>June: We started a quant circle, an online group sharing session where each club member learns and implements quant-related topics and shares what they learned on the Discord server. We also organize an online Linear Algebra class.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Join Us?</h2>
    <p>We now have social media accounts on <a href="https://medium.com/quant-cu">Medium</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quantcu/">Instagram</a>. We also have a Discord server where we will soon set up a form for club member recruitment. If you’re really enthusiastic about this field, you can direct message our Instagram account. Our staff will then talk with you and invite you to join the server.</p>
    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>This website format is heavily inspired by <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>. To be straightforward, the club president wants this site to be more than just nearly pure HTML. However, since he doesn’t have web development skills, he’s currently looking for an active web developer to rebuild the site. (And that could be you!)</p>
